![Aviation Consultancy](assets/images/logo-image.jpg)

***Sky-Hi Technologies** is (fictitious) consultancy business specialising in aircraft maintenance data and regulatory compliance, based at 
London Heathrow Airport.
I designed the website to be a showcase of the available services and a means for new customers to make contact with the business allowing project and service requests to be submitted. 
It's services are B2B so not required to sell any products directly via the site.*

![Responsive Layout Screenshots](/wireframes/am-i-responsive.jpg) 

*I created the Sky-Hi Technologies logo to present a professional, trustworthy image based on research of similar contemporary consultancy service websites 
(details of these websites can be found in the Credits section). The colour scheme was chosen from the Blue / Green colours to reflect a calm balanced approach as well as to 
blend well with the aviation and sky themes.*

## Design Choices ##

### Topology ###

![topology](assets/images/topology.png)

### Fonts ###

I have chosen [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?query=Oswald) for all of the headers and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=Roboto) the rest of the text.

### Colours ###

I have chosen the colours that say 'trust' and 'dependable' buy using light blue, white and black to compliment the aviation theme. The images used in the site display a range of blue tones and so the palette choice also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/coolors-palette-sm.png)

- *Black* (000000) - Black
- *Onyx* (444444) - Dark Grey
- *Light Blue* (ADD8E6) - Sky blue
- *White* (FFFFFF) - White

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating a professional, clean website.

### Wireframes ###

I designed the site mock-ups originally using pen and paper and then developing the designs further using [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/).

I'm focusing on defining the basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet and desktop for each page.

#### Hand drawn drafts ####

The original hand drawn sketch wireframes were created as quick and rough method to try out page formatting ideas to form a basis for creating the wireframe within balsamic.

They represent the early stages of the design process for the website as ideas started to form and the flow of the design process from idea to finished website.

- [Terms & Conditions / Privacy Policy](wireframes/original-drafts/wireframe-mobile-tc-privacy-draft.jpg)

#### Final Wireframes ####

The final wireframes were created using Balsamiq adapted from the original hand drawn wireframe concepts. Each image shows a page from the site in three display sizes to demonstrate the page design and layout.

## SEO ##

Search Engine Optimisation for the site was provided in three complementary ways:
 - HTML Sitemap links
 - XML sitemap file saved in the root directory
 - Google Search Console
 
#### HTML Sitemap links ####
- **Secondary** HTML links to each page in the website were added to the footer section of each site page to allow users an alternative means of navigating the site easily.

#### XML Sitemap file ####
- A sitemap.xml file was created to help search engines find, crawl and index the website more easily. It was created by using XML-Sitemaps.com and entering the URL for the deployed website and letting it automatically generate the required xml data for the whole site.
The file was then saved in the GitHub repository root directory.

- The following steps were used to generate the sitemap.xml file:
  1. Visit [XML-Sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and enter the URL of the website https://simonjvardy.github.io/Aviation-Consultancy/
  2. Click Start
  3. The site pages will automatically be scanned 
  4. Click View Sitemap Details
  5. Download the XML sitemap file
  6. Save the sitemap.xml file in the root directory of the GitHub repository

#### Google Search Console ####
- Google Search Console was used to assist with testing and indexing issues with the website and to see how the site performs in Google search results.

- The following steps were used to perform the indexing tests:
  1.  Visit [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home)
  2.  Click Add Property in the menu bar
  3.  Enter the website URL https://simonjvardy.github.io/Aviation-Consultancy/
  4.  Click Continue
  5.  Download the unique verification file created by Google
  6.  Save the [verification file](googlef750fda78af5a952.html) in the root directory of the GitHub repository
  7.  On Google Search Console, click Verify
  8.  Once the verification passes, the site is available in the Google Search COnsole dashboard.

Even though this website has a small number of pages and have navigation links on each page making the Sitemap largely unnecessary, I felt is was a good experience and good practice to add these features in.
Note: I haven't added a robots.txt file yet but may add this in the future when I understand more about search engine optimisation techniques.

## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate [branches](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/branches)  used to work on specific aspects of the project.
The following describes the repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
    - Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 

The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.

#### Gitpod Workspaces ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.

#### Branches ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.

#### Working within a branch ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronised, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.

#### Merging branches in GitHub ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to the **Development project**.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.

#### Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.

## Project Management ##

GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/projects/1) are used to organise the planning and development of the website using the Automated kanban template.
The following project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Backlog** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Review in progress** - Pull requests are automatically moved here by project automation options when the reviewer requests any changes to be carried out.
    - As there is only one contributor on this project currently, most pull requests bypass this card as the request is usually reviewed and merged in the same step.
- **Reviewer approved** - Pull requests are automatically moved here by project automation options when they meet the minimum number of required reviews.
    - As there is only one contributor currently, most pull requests bypass this card as the request is usually reviewed and merged in the same step.
- **Testing** - Testing tasks list
- **Done** - completed tasks

Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

## Testing ##

- Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.

---
## Bugs ##

To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/projects/1)

Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.

Fixed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
